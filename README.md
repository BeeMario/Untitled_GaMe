So, NTBeta deleted this, so I'll bring it back. This is a simple game where you can choose story lines and stuff.

# What happened to the original!?!??!??!?!

Apparently, NTBeta no longer wanted to work on it.

# Will everything be the same?

I can try.

# How to play?

Download the files, and run them. If you need help, contact me on Discord: carneliantius#0990, or [Google](https://google.com/) it.
